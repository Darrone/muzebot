# MuzeBOT
lol

**As of right now**
Need "token.txt" to read the BOT's token. Do not add it to GitHub because that's the BOT's "Password"

### TO DO:
- [] Play from url
- [x] Add Queue of songs
- [x] Show Queue
- [x] Shuffle Queue
- [x] Skip
- [x] Remove from queue
- [x] Search youtube (Webcrawling)
- [x] Play from URL directly
- [x] Play through webcrawling search
- [ ] Spotify Maybe????

- More ideas to come
  - Maybe not only music bot?
  - simple tasks? We will see

Basic Music Bot started from [Rapptz's example](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/tree/master/examples)
